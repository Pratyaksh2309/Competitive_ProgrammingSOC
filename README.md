# Hello
## I am Pratyaksh Bhardwaj

- 1st week: just started DSA. So i am a little bit slow . I did 10 questions(neetcode) and 5 questions(Problem Set). 
- 2nd week: Completed 5 more questions(Problem Set) and 8 questions(neetcode) + i am also following IICPC Camp resources.
- 3rd week: Completed 9 more questions(Problem Set) and completed STL. I have started understanding greedy problems. I also did 10 questions on neetcode. I could not attempt the contest conducted by SOC that's why I tried solving the contest and did 5 out of 8 questions and discussed problems with mentors. I have also given the contest conducted by WnCC DSA Bootcamp.

   ### After three weeks, I have become confident in STL and now moved to greedy problems. I am still practising more and more.
