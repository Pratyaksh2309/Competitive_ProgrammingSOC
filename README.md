# Hello
## I am Pratyaksh Bhardwaj (23B2401) 
### This is my github repository for SOC 2024 : ID-07 Competitive Programming

- 1st week: just started DSA. So i am a little bit slow . I did 10 questions(neetcode) and 5 questions(Problem Set). 
- 2nd week: Completed 5 more questions(Problem Set) and 8 questions(neetcode) + I am also following IICPC Camp resources.
- 3rd week: Completed 11 more questions(Problem Set) and completed STL. I have started understanding greedy problems. I also did 8 questions on neetcode. I could not attempt the contest conducted by SOC that's why I tried solving the contest and did 5 out of 8 questions and discussed problems with mentors. I have also given the contest conducted by WnCC DSA Bootcamp.
- 4th week: I did many questions on greedy problems and give WnCC bootcamp contests. I require practice.
- 5th week: I started DP and continue in the same. I am practicing more questions for the same. I got a little busy in LearnerSpace too.

   ### After five weeks, I have become confident in STL, Greedy problems and doing more and more questions on Dynamic Programming . I am still practising more and more.


    Checkpoint 1 includes the neetcode problems like two pointers and arrays and hashing basics. After that there is a separate folder for each work I did.
  
#### For NEETCODE Problems: The main answer is the function which is called inside main() and therefore no importance is given to how the input is given as it is given by the neetcode website by itself.
